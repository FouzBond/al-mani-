  &nbsp;<span class="contentheading">T</span>he University of Technology, Mauritius (UTM) was created in year 2000 by Act of Parliament as the Government implemented its plan to have a second University which would focus towards development of oriented sectors in particular. Two state institutions namely the Mauritius Institute of Public Administration and Management (MIPAM) and the State Information Training Centre (SITRAC Ltd) were merged to form the University of Technology, Mauritius. This historic step in the field of higher education was prompted mainly by the need to cater more vigorously for the increasing demand for ICT and Management professionals in a country which is seriously committed to accelerate, by all means, the realization of its ambition to become a major service provider in the field of Information Technology, Management and Finance, Sustainable Development and allied areas. The University started operation by the end of year 2000. The Board of Governors (B.O.G), was in place and in year 2001, created its senior management personnel.</p>

            <p align="justify">
  The UTM became fully operational in August 2001. Initially two Schools were created: the School of Business Informatics and Software Engineering (SOBISE) and the School of Public Sector Policy and Management (SOPSPAM) to welcome their first cohorts of undergraduate students.</p>

            <p>
  The UTM has embarked on a strategy of expansion to minimise, as far as possible, the consequence of its infrastructural and financial constraints to meet the growing challenges of the tertiary education sector. Efforts in that direction have been multi fold through:<br>
  (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; Increase of programmes<br>
  (ii)&nbsp; Diversification of fields of study which is linked with the creation of new Schools<br>
  (iii) Several Memoranda of Understanding with different institutions viz.:</p>

            <strong>PLANNING FOR 2010 ONWARDS</strong>
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              The future directions of the UTM and the realisation of its Vision, Mission, Aims and Objectives will be directly linked to the availability of a proper campus targeted within the next 2-3 years.</li>
            <li>
              Growth is a direct consequence of the availability of resources namely, infrastructural, financial and human.</li>
            <li>
              The demands for higher education will continue to rise in a context of accelerated economic, social and cultural development of the country and the region.</li>
            <li>
              The UTM will be able to finance and develop a viable network of distance/online education for increased access and for new growth poles.</li>
            <li>
              There will be closer ties between UTM and the private sector for the creation of an enterprising and stimulating learning and research environment.</li>
            <li>
              Links arrangements with universities abroad will grow on the basis of improved international networks and capability.</li>
            <li>
              Post secondary education will benefit from a more equable cost sharing system whereby the disparity between the fee paying and non fee paying student is reduced to the minimum.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            <strong>ACADEMIC STRUCTURE</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            The UTM presently comprises of four schools namely:
          </p>

          <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
            <li>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;School of Business, Management and Finance</li>
            <li>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;School of Sustainable Development and Tourism</li>
            <li>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;School of Innovative Technologies and Engineering</li>
            <li>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;School of Health Sciences</li>
          </ul><br/>

          <p>
            <strong>PROVISION OF NEW CAMPUS </strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            The new campus at Cote DOr should provide for the following facilities to sustain long term growth:<br>
            1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Student Centre comprising Student union officeand Game room and space for leisure<br>
            2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Infrastructure for an Engineering School<br>
            3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Necessary building to have existing and new Schools<br>
            4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Canteen for students and staff<br>
            5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Finance and Administration<br>
            6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Five Storey Resource Centre<br>
            7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Library/Bookshop on campus with stationery facilities and photocopy service<br>
            8.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Health facilities + Creche<br>
            9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fully equipped Gymnasium<br>
            10.&nbsp;&nbsp; Auditorium with all facilities<br>
            11.&nbsp;&nbsp; Halls of Residence for students<br>
            12.&nbsp;&nbsp; On Campus Accommodation for overseas visitors and research fellows
          </p>

          <p>
  There is no doubt that successful achievement of the above strategic targets would contribute to the UTMs growth towards a well deserved international status and as a contributor to the economic and social development of the country.&nbsp; This implies a strong commitment and timely support for UTM to make that quantum leap in the interest of the country.
